# UU2019-Hamming-Code
Project for course "Programmeren in de Wiskunde". Python program for Hamming code data correction.
Run main.py to start with (compiled executable provided in Releases). User can use a parity bit code or a Hamming code of their own choice, input their own message and correct randomly generated errors.


Note: the file breuk.py is more or less totally irrelevant to the project itself, but it contains a class defining fractions which can be useful when using the matrices from BitMatrix.py in non-binary mode (for purposes other than Hamming codes).
